Reading Great Code
==================

One of the tenets of Python is creating readable code. 
The motivation for this is simple: The predominant activity in Python programming 
is reading code.

One of the secrets of becoming a great Python programmer is to read,
understand, and appreciate excellent code.

Excellent code always follows guidelines, like those outlined in :ref:`code_style`.
Excellent code strives to concisely express its intent to the reader.

Here are some recommended Python projects for reading. Each of
these projects is a paragon of excellent Python code.

- `Howdoi <https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi>`_
  Howdoi is a code search tool, written in Python.

- `Flask <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask>`_
  Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja2.
  It's intended for getting started very quickly and was developed with
  best intentions in mind.

- `Werkzeug <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug>`_
  Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
  applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules.
