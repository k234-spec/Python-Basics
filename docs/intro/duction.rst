* `learnpython.org <http://www.learnpython.org/>`_ - Learnpython.org is an easy non-intimidating way to get introduced to python. The website takes the same approach used on the popular `Try Ruby <http://tryruby.org/>`_ website, it has an interactive python interpreter built into the site that allows you to go through the lessons without having to install Python locally.

* `Dive Into Python 3 <http://diveintopython3.ep.io/>`_ - Dive into Python 3 is a no non-sense approach to Python and is suited for someone that already knows how to program but now wants to learn Python.
