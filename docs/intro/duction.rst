About the Hitchhiker's Guide
----------------------------

By the Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python is hosted in `Kenneth Reitz's GitHub
<https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide>`_, but it is not by him.
Rather, it is a community-driven effort to document the best finds in
Python, tips and tricks from, help for choosing frameworks, libraries, and
licenses, and more.

For the Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All contributions to the Guide are welcome, from Pythonistas of all levels.
If you think there's a gap in what the Guide covers, fork the Guide on
GitHub and submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome from everyone,
whether they're an old hand or a first-time Pythonista, and the authors to
the Guide will gladly help if you have any questions about the
appropriateness, completeness, or accuracy of a contribution.

To get started working on The Hitchhiker's Guide, see
the :doc:`/notes/contribute` page.
