Properly Installing Python
==========================

There's a good chance that you already have Python on your operating system.

If so, you do not need to install or configure anything else to use Python.
Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you install the tools and
libraries described in the guides below before you start building Python
applications for real-world use. In particular, you should always install
Distribute, Pip, and Virtualenv — they make it much easier for you to use
other third-party Python libraries.

Installation Guides

These guides go over the proper installation of :ref:`Python 2.7 <which-python>`
 for development purposes, as well as distribute, pip, and virtualenv setup.

- :ref:`Mac OS X <install-osx>`.
- :ref:`Microsoft Windows<install-windows>`.
- :ref:`Ubuntu Linux <install-linux>`.

Installing Python with Using Popular Python Distributions
=========================================================

Installing one of the below Python distribution, make it easy to configure 
Python environment easier for beginners. Popular libraries (Matplotlib, Numpy,
Pandas etc.) will be installed with these distributions.
