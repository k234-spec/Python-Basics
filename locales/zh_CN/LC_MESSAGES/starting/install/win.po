"By design, Python installs to a directory with the version number "
"embedded, e.g. Python version 2.7 will install at "
":file:`C:\\\\Python27\\\\`, so that you can have multiple versions of "
"Python on the same system without conflicts. Of course, only one "
"interpreter can be the default application for Python file types. It also"
" does not automatically modify the :envvar:`PATH` environment variable, "

" that, I would strongly recommend that you install the tools and "
"libraries described in the next section before you start building Python "
"applications for real-world use. In particular, you should always install"
