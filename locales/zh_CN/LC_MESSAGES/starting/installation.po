"If so, you do not need to install or configure anything else to use "
"Python. Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you install the"
" tools and libraries described in the guides below before you start "
"building Python applications for real-world use. In particular, you "
"should always install Setuptools, Pip, and Virtualenv — they make it much"
" easier for you to use other third-party Python libraries."

"The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2. Consider "

"*still* using Python 2 in production today. If you are using Python 3, "
"congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste. —*Kenneth "
