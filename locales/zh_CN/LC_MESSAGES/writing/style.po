"If you ask Python programmers what they like most about Python, they will"

msgid "Arguments can be passed to functions in four different ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:95
msgid ""
"**Positional arguments** are mandatory and have no default values. They "
"are the simplest form of arguments and they can be used for the few "
"function arguments that are fully part of the function's meaning and "
"their order is natural. For instance, in ``send(message, recipient)`` or "
"``point(x, y)`` the user of the function has no difficulty remembering "
"that those two functions require two arguments, and in which order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:102
msgid ""
"In those two cases, it is possible to use argument names when calling the"
" functions and, doing so, it is possible to switch the order of "
"arguments, calling for instance ``send(recipient='World', "
"message='Hello')`` and ``point(y=2, x=1)`` but this reduces readability "
"and is unnecessarily verbose, compared to the more straightforward calls "
"to ``send('Hello', 'World')`` and ``point(1, 2)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:109
msgid ""
"**Keyword arguments** are not mandatory and have default values. They are"
" often used for optional parameters sent to the function. When a function"
" has more than two or three positional parameters, its signature is more "
"difficult to remember and using keyword arguments with default values is "
"helpful. For instance, a more complete ``send`` function could be defined"
" as ``send(message, to, cc=None, bcc=None)``. Here ``cc`` and ``bcc`` are"
" optional, and evaluate to ``None`` when they are not passed another "
"value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:117
msgid ""
"Calling a function with keyword arguments can be done in multiple ways in"
" Python; for example, it is possible to follow the order of arguments in "
"the definition without explicitly naming the arguments, like in "
"``send('Hello', 'World', 'Cthulhu', 'God')``, sending a blind carbon copy"
" to God. It would also be possible to name arguments in another order, "
"like in ``send('Hello again', 'World', bcc='God', cc='Cthulhu')``. Those "
"two possibilities are better avoided without any strong reason to not "
"follow the syntax that is the closest to the function definition: "
"``send('Hello', 'World', cc='Cthulhu', bcc='God')``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:127
msgid ""
"As a side note, following the `YAGNI "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it>`_ principle, it is"
" often harder to remove an optional argument (and its logic inside the "
"function) that was added \"just in case\" and is seemingly never used, "
"than to add a new optional argument and its logic when needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:132
msgid ""
"The **arbitrary argument list** is the third way to pass arguments to a "
"function. If the function intention is better expressed by a signature "
"with an extensible number of positional arguments, it can be defined with"
" the ``*args`` constructs. In the function body, ``args`` will be a tuple"
" of all the remaining positional arguments. For example, ``send(message, "
"*args)`` can be called with each recipient as an argument: "
"``send('Hello', 'God', 'Mom', 'Cthulhu')``, and in the function body "
"``args`` will be equal to ``('God', 'Mom', 'Cthulhu')``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:141
msgid ""
"However, this construct has some drawbacks and should be used with "
"caution. If a function receives a list of arguments of the same nature, "
"it is often more clear to define it as a function of one argument, that "
"argument being a list or any sequence. Here, if ``send`` has multiple "
"recipients, it is better to define it explicitly: ``send(message, "
"recipients)`` and call it with ``send('Hello', ['God', 'Mom', "
"'Cthulhu'])``. This way, the user of the function can manipulate the "
"recipient list as a list beforehand, and it opens the possibility to pass"
" any sequence, including iterators, that cannot be unpacked as other "
"sequences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:150
msgid ""
"The **arbitrary keyword argument dictionary** is the last way to pass "
"arguments to functions. If the function requires an undetermined series "
"of named arguments, it is possible to use the ``**kwargs`` construct. In "
"the function body, ``kwargs`` will be a dictionary of all the passed "
"named arguments that have not been caught by other keyword arguments in "
"the function signature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:157
msgid ""
"The same caution as in the case of *arbitrary argument list* is "
"necessary, for similar reasons: these powerful techniques are to be used "
"when there is a proven necessity to use them, and they should not be used"
" if the simpler and clearer construct is sufficient to express the "
"function's intention."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:162
msgid ""
"It is up to the programmer writing the function to determine which "
"arguments are positional arguments and which are optional keyword "
"arguments, and to decide whether to use the advanced techniques of "
"arbitrary argument passing. If the advice above is followed wisely, it is"
" possible and enjoyable to write Python functions that are:"

"A powerful tool for hackers, Python comes with a very rich set of hooks "

"However, all these options have many drawbacks and it is always better to"
" use the most straightforward way to achieve your goal. The main drawback"
" is that readability suffers greatly when using these constructs. Many "
"code analysis tools, such as pylint or pyflakes, will be unable to parse "
"this \"magic\" code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:191
msgid ""
"We consider that a Python developer should know about these nearly "
"infinite possibilities, because it instills confidence that no impassable"
" problem will be on the way. However, knowing how and particularly when "
"**not** to use them is very important."

msgid "We are all responsible users"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:202
msgid ""
"As seen above, Python allows many tricks, and some of them are "
"potentially dangerous. A good example is that any client code can "
"override an object's properties and methods: there is no \"private\" "
"keyword in Python. This philosophy, very different from highly defensive "
"languages like Java, which give a lot of mechanisms to prevent any "
"misuse, is expressed by the saying: \"We are all responsible users\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:209
msgid ""
"This doesn't mean that, for example, no properties are considered "
"private, and that no proper encapsulation is possible in Python. Rather, "
"instead of relying on concrete walls erected by the developers between "
"their code and others', the Python community prefers to rely on a set of "
"conventions indicating that these elements should not be accessed "
"directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:215
msgid ""
"The main convention for private properties and implementation details is "
"to prefix all \"internals\" with an underscore. If the client code breaks"
" this rule and accesses these marked elements, any misbehavior or "
"problems encountered if the code is modified is the responsibility of the"
" client code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:220
msgid ""
"Using this convention generously is encouraged: any method or property "
"that is not intended to be used by client code should be prefixed with an"
" underscore. This will guarantee a better separation of duties and easier"
" modification of existing code; it will always be possible to publicize a"
" private property, but making a public property private might be a much "
"harder operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:227
msgid "Returning values"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:229
msgid ""
"When a function grows in complexity, it is not uncommon to use multiple "
"return statements inside the function's body. However, in order to keep a"
" clear intent and a sustainable readability level, it is preferable to "
"avoid returning meaningful values from many output points in the body."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:234
msgid ""
"There are two main cases for returning values in a function: the result "
"of the function return when it has been processed normally, and the error"
" cases that indicate a wrong input parameter or any other reason for the "
"function to not be able to complete its computation or task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:239
msgid ""
"If you do not wish to raise exceptions for the second case, then "
"returning a value, such as None or False, indicating that the function "
"could not perform correctly might be needed. In this case, it is better "
"to return as early as the incorrect context has been detected. It will "
"help to flatten the structure of the function: all the code after the "
"return-because-of-error statement can assume the condition is met to "
"further compute the function's main result. Having multiple such return "
"statements is often necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/style.rst:247
msgid ""
"However, when a function has multiple main exit points for its normal "
"course, it becomes difficult to debug the returned result, so it may be "
"preferable to keep a single exit point. This will also help factoring out"
" some code paths, and the multiple exit points are a probable indication "
"that such a refactoring is needed."

"Even though both functions look identical, because *lookup_set* is "
