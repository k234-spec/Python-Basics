"The :mod:`logging` module has been a part of Python's Standard Library "
"since version 2.3.  It is succinctly described in :pep:`282`.  The "
"documentation is notoriously hard to read, except for the `basic logging "
"tutorial`_."

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:13

"As an alternative, `loguru <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>`_ provides "
"an approach for logging, nearly as simple as using a simple ``print`` "
"statement."

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:15
msgid "Logging serves two purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:17
msgid ""
"**Diagnostic logging** records events related to the application's "
"operation. If a user calls in to report an error, for example, the logs "
"can be searched for context."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Audit logging** records events for business analysis. A user's "
"transactions can be extracted and combined with other user details for "
"reports or to optimize a business goal."
msgstr ""

msgid "... or Print?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:29

"The only time that ``print`` is a better option than logging is when the "
"goal is to display a help statement for a command line application. Other"
" reasons why logging is better than ``print``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:33
msgid ""
"The `log record`_, which is created with every logging event, contains "
"readily available diagnostic information such as the file name, full "
"path, function, and line number of the logging event."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:36
msgid ""
"Events logged in included modules are automatically accessible via the "
"root logger to your application's logging stream, unless you filter them "
"out."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:38

"Logging can be selectively silenced by using the method "
":meth:`logging.Logger.setLevel` or disabled by setting the attribute "
":attr:`logging.Logger.disabled` to ``True``."

"Notes for `configuring logging for a library`_ are in the `logging "
"tutorial`_.  Because the *user*, not the library, should dictate what "
"happens when a logging event occurs, one admonition bears repeating:"

msgid ""
"It is strongly advised that you do not add any handlers other than "
"NullHandler to your libraryâ€™s loggers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:57
msgid ""
"Best practice when instantiating loggers in a library is to only create "
"them using the ``__name__`` global variable: the :mod:`logging` module "
"creates a hierarchy of loggers using dot notation, so using ``__name__`` "
"ensures no name collisions."

"The `twelve factor app <https://12factor.net>`_, an authoritative "
"reference for good practice in application development, contains a "
"section on `logging best practice <https://12factor.net/logs>`_. It "
"emphatically advocates for treating log events as an event stream, and "
"for sending that event stream to standard output to be handled by the "
"application environment."

"**Pro**: possible to update configuration while running, using the "

#: ../../writing/logging.rst:88
msgid ""
"**Con**: less control (e.g. custom subclassed filters or loggers) than "
