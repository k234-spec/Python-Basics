"By now it should be clear that using virtual environments is a great way "
"to keep your development environment clean and keeping different "
"projects' requirements separate."

msgid ""
"When you start working on many different projects, it can be hard to "
"remember to activate the related virtual environment when you come back "
"to a specific project.  As a result of this, it is very easy to install "
"packages globally while thinking that you are actually installing the "
"package for the virtual environment of the project. Over time this can "
"result in a messy global package list."

"In order to make sure that you install packages to your active virtual "
"environment when you use ``pip install``, consider adding the following "
"line to your :file:`~/.bashrc` file:"

msgid ""
"After saving this change and sourcing the :file:`~/.bashrc` file with "
"``source ~/.bashrc``, pip will no longer let you install packages if you "
"are not in a virtual environment.  If you try to use ``pip install`` "
"outside of a virtual environment pip will gently remind you that an "
"activated virtual environment is needed to install packages."

"You can also do this configuration by editing your :file:`pip.conf` or "
":file:`pip.ini` file. :file:`pip.conf` is used by Unix and Mac OS X "
"operating systems and it can be found at:"

"You will of course need to install some packages globally (usually ones "
"that you use across different projects consistently) and this can be "

msgid ""
"After saving the changes and sourcing your :file:`~/.bashrc` file you can"

"Every developer has preferred libraries and when you are working on a lot"
" of different projects, you are bound to have some overlap between the "
"libraries that you use. For example, you may be using the ``requests`` "
"library in a lot of different projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/pip-virtualenv.rst:98
msgid ""
"It is surely unnecessary to re-download the same packages/libraries each "
"time you start working on a new project (and in a new virtual environment"
" as a result). Fortunately, starting with version 6.0, pip provides an "
"`on-by-default caching mechanism "
"<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#caching>`_ that "
"doesn't need any configuration."

"On Unix systems, you can add the following line to your :file:`.bashrc` "

"You can set the path to anywhere you like (as long as you have write "

#: ../../dev/pip-virtualenv.rst:119

"Another way of doing the same configuration is via the :file:`pip.conf` "
"or :file:`pip.ini` files, depending on your system. If you are on "
"Windows, you can add the following line to your :file:`pip.ini` file "
"under ``[global]`` settings:"

"Even though you can use any path you like to store your cache, it is "

":file:`pip.conf` or :file:`pip.ini` file lives. If you don't trust "
"yourself with all of this path voodoo, just use the values provided here "
"and you will be fine."
