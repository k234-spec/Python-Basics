"Martin Fowler, who first wrote about `Continuous Integration "

"CI) together with Kent Beck, describes CI as follows:"

"Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members "
"of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates"
" at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each "
"integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect "
"integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this "
"approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a"
" team to develop cohesive software more rapidly."
