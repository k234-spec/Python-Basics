"Most image processing and manipulation techniques can be carried out "
"effectively using two libraries: Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Open "
"Source Computer Vision (OpenCV)."

"The `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, "
"or PIL for short, is one of the core libraries for image manipulation in "
"Python. Unfortunately, its development has stagnated, with its last "
"release in 2009."

"Luckily for you, there's an actively-developed fork of PIL called `Pillow"
" <http://python-pillow.github.io/>`_ -- it's easier to install, runs on "
"all major operating systems, and supports Python 3."

"Open Source Computer Vision, more commonly known as OpenCV, is a more "

"In Python, image processing using OpenCV is implemented using the ``cv2``"
" and ``NumPy`` modules.  The `installation instructions for OpenCV "
