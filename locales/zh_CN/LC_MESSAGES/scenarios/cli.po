"Command-line applications, also referred to as `Console Applications "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application>`_, are computer "
"programs designed to be used from a text interface, such as a `shell "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>`_. Command-line "
"applications usually accept various inputs as arguments, often referred "
"to as parameters or sub-commands, as well as options, often referred to "
"as flags or switches."

"Python standard library `argparse "

"its complexity by using a declarative interface: the argument parser is "
"inferred rather than written down imperatively. This module targets "
"unsophisticated users, programmers, sysadmins, scientists, and in general"
" people writing throw-away scripts for themselves, who choose to create a"
" command-line interface because it is quick and simple."

"``svn`` and ``git``, where the main program handles some basic argument "
