"Python’s standard urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP capabilities "
"you need, but the API is thoroughly broken. It was built for a different "
"time — and a different web. It requires an enormous amount of work (even "
"method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks."

"Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP — making your "
"integration with web services seamless. There’s no need to manually add "
"query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive "
"and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which"
" is embedded within Requests."

"ØMQ (also spelled ZeroMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous "
"messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent "
"applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented "
"middleware, a ØMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The "
"library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API."
