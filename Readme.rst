# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

**Work in progress. If you'd like to help, please do. There's a lot of work to
be done.**

This guide is currently under heavy development. This opinionated guide
exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice
handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily
basis.


Topics include:

- Platform and version-specific installations
- Py2app, Py2exe, bbfreeze, pyInstaller
- Pip
- Numpy, scipy, statpy, pyplot, matplotlib
- Virtualenv
- Fabric
- Exhaustive module recommendations, grouped by topic/purpose
- Which libraries to use for what
- Server configurations & tools for various web frameworks
- Documentation: writing it
- Testing: Jenkins & tox guides
- How to easily interface ``hg`` from ``git``

If you aren't fond of reading reStructuredText, there is an
almost up-to-date `HTML version at docs.python-guide.org
<https://docs.python-guide.org>`_.
